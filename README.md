# Queer or Not
Queer or Not is a simple web game, where you'll be paired with a random stranger, and both of you will have one minute of text conversation, to try and guess whether the other person is queer or not. This program was developed for Summer of Making 2025, a program organized by the awesome folk at Hack Club. I also have taken very obvious inspiration from [Human or Not](https://humanornot.ai/), a game that pairs you with a random stranger and asks you to guess whether they are human or an AI model faking being a human.

# Why?
A friend of mine once said that the internet was the place where everyone let their rue colors shine. As humans, we lose our social inhibitions when we ineract with others in the internet, and, without purposeful intent, we often become an almost comically exagerated version of ourselves. This is especially true for queer people, who often feel more comfortable expressing themselves online than in real life. I wanted to create a game that would allow people to explore this idea in a fun and lighthearted way.

I am also slighly curious about how easily and reliably queer people can be identified in the internet, and how much your own queerness can influence your perception of others. This game is a fun way to explore that idea, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it! <3
