      <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="question" onClick="answer('answer4')">What was the inspiration behind this game?</a>
      <div class="answer" id="answer4">
        <p>The game was inspired by the desire to create a fun and engaging way to explore and discuss queer identities in a light-hearted manner. It takes heavy inspiration from "Human or Not", a similar game where you are paired with either a human or an AI, and have to guess which one they are.</p>
        <p>No, that doesn't mean that Queer people are more human.</p>
